				<p>Sam’s experience in structured settlements began over twenty five years ago and his Manhattan office has represented EPS Settlements Group in New York for the past 15 years.</p>
				<p>Sam provides annuity quotes, detailed life‐care plan review, and NY State CPLR § 50A &amp; § 50B analysis. He is well‐versed on the Medicaid-Medicare issues that must be dealt with on liability settlements as well as the New York State Medical Indemnity Fund (MIF). He also prepares settlement and court documents, attends court conferences and mediations, conducts file reviews and lectures frequently on structured settlements.</p>
				<p>Sam is an active member of many industry organizations such as the Association for Healthcare Risk Management of New York (AHRMNY), and The Maritime Law Association of the U.S. (Marine Torts and Casualties Committee). Sam has served as President, Treasurer and is currently a member of the AHRMNY Board of Directors, an organization focused on the prevention of hospital based liability claims.</p>

				<div class="qa">
					<p class="q">What sets you apart from other structure brokers?</p>
					<p class="a">A sophisticated understanding of the settlement process, especially in my home state of New York. So many of my competitors are completely unfamiliar with the application of New York’s varied laws which impact on different categories of settlements. Wrongful Death settlements are treated differently than Personal Injury settlements, which are treated differently than Medical Malpractice settlements, which are further complicated by the New York Medical Indemnity Fund. Understanding the nuances of how each case is calculated for settlement, judgment or distribution to an estate is essential to creating a quality structured settlement quote.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="qa">
					<p class="q">Why make these settlement calculators available online?</p>
					<p class="a">I want to provide my clients with accessible tools that will help resolve cases. Knowledge is power and having the ability to calculate quickly, from your computer or your phone, a possible settlement outcome will absolutely help achieve positive settlement results.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="qa">
					<p class="q">How can calculators achieve “positive settlement results?</p>
					<p class="a">By assisting in a factual and realistic discussion of damages. The calculators create very precise settlement breakdowns, either by inputting a total desired settlement to see the breakdown, or by inputting settlement components to arrive at a total settlement amount. Each calculator is specific to a body of law governing a claim. For example, a Medical Malpractice claim can be calculated under the NY Medical Indemnity Fund and even with consideration given to a derivative claim allocation to a child’s parent. That detailed breakdown allows for a more precise understanding of a plaintiff’s net recovery which in turn allows for a precise allocation for a structured settlement’s creation.</p>
				</div>

				<p>Similarly, a Wrongful Death claim resulting from either Personal Injury or Medical Malpractice must consider how the case precedents, <em>Matter of Kaiser</em> or <em>Matter of Acquafreda</em>, will allocate settlement proceeds amongst the decedent’s survivors. And that settlement discussion should be based on an understanding of the <em>Toledo</em> case which governs the pre judgment interest owed and discounting of a Wrongful Death verdict in New York under the CPLR.</p>

				<p><strong><i>Understanding Constructive Receipt:</i></strong><br>Why can’t a plaintiff create their own structured settlement? At the core of the federal tax code's explicit recognition of structured settlements is the concept of constructive receipt. This NSSTA handout offers a concise explanation about Congress' intent and how the Internal Revenue Service has traditionally interpreted its application.</p>

				<p><a href="#" class="file-link"><img src="images/icon_page.png" alt="file">Senders NSSTA Constructive Receipt handout.pdf</a></p>

				<p><strong><i>Understanding Qualified Assignments:</i></strong><br>The essential contract that protects the defendants or insurer’s interests when assigning its obligation to make future periodic payments. The assignment transfers full responsibility for all future payments to an independent third party. And when done correctly removes from the defendant all future responsibility to the claimant. This NSSTA handout offers a concise explanation of how defendants and insurers protect themselves with Qualified Assignments.</p>

				<p><strong><i>Understanding the Plaintiff’s Needs:</i></strong><br>The following NSSTA handouts address the needs of plaintiffs across the personal injury spectrum.
