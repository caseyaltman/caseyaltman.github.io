				<h1>Who will visit your site? What value does your website offer to its visitors?</h1>
					<p>This is the new era of inventing / re-inventing everything. The new 1900 when everything was about being created . . . and there is a vast amount of creative people out there working in non-creative jobs or environments, with big dreams and potential but suffering of lack of guidance. I am talking (engineers, inventors, creatives from ad agencies, strategists, developers) with the need to have a creative way to express and materialize their ideas or to have ideas that can be materialized when their resources and brains can't produce anything else. They need ideas and/or prototypes. Sometimes both.</p>
